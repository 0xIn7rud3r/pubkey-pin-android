# pubkey-pin-android
Just another example for Android Public Key Pinning (based on OWASP example https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning#Android).
The OWASP example doesnt work and you can read about this here https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning#Android_example_contains_code_that_breaks_apps.
So I got the Android Developer "Security with HTTPS and SSL" (https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html) best practice and implemented on the OWASP example.
